# The TA Schedule and Links to Recordings

This repo allows us to use github to collaborate on TA sessions.

All TA sessions will be recorded just like class for students that are unable to attend the live session.

Tickets for admittance to TA sessions must be requested at least one day in advance. *No-show to TA sessions is not acceptable*. If you must cancel, do so well in advance. TA time is valuable time.

- [Fridays with Sasha 6pm to 8pm](fridays-with-sasha-6pm-to-8pm)

- [Tuesdays with Shani 2pm to 4pm](tuesdays-with-shani-2pm-4pm)

## Request a Ticket

Use your git skills to make a fork, clone and then update the README for the session you would like to attend. Make a change and a PR for each individual TA and assign that TA to the PR. Make a PR to be accepted to the session. Make your PR at least 12 hours in advance. Share a link to your PR in slack in #asking-for-help. Ideally place your PR 24 hours in advance as a minimum but PRs made withing hours can also be possible. Good programming includes good planning. 

If you do not get a response to your PR, place a follow up message on slack in #asking-for-help and mention the TA for the session you PR'd for.

The TA will approve your pull request and provide you with your ticket to attend.

Navigate to the session you would like to attend.
Update the README to include your full name and a description of anything specific for the TA to prepare for.
